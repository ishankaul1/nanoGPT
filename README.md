# **NanoGPT SideQuest** ⚔️🪄🏰

Getting hands-on with **[NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)** to explore and understand:

- 🧠 Transformer architecture itself  
- 🏗️ Infrastructure for training, evaluating, and serving transformers  
- 🔥 PyTorch fundamentals  
- 🧪 The experimentation process end-to-end

Currently dialing in on repeatable gpu training/experiment infra. Project tracking moved to my personal Notion.
